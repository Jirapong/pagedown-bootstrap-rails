# PageDown Bootstrap Rails

Fork from [https://github.com/hughevans/pagedown-bootstrap-rails](https://github.com/hughevans/pagedown-bootstrap-rails). The idea was to migrate to Bootstrap 3 and then create a pull request.

## Changes

- Removed image file and two icons from the button bar which are missing in FontAwesome.
- FontAwesome icons are used for the rest.
- Insert link and image dialogs migrated to Bootstrap 3.
- Added localization support.
- Added init script.
